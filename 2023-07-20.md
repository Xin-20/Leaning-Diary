# Today's work
- [x] make a test of document search project  
take the cls info  
- [ ] check the tts process I did before and check my phoneme translate model  
- [ ] Maybe use Bert to train, make the last output layer out and no sofrmax after that, then use a conversion between sr and time, so we can get the distribution of prob for each phoneme at any second   
# Questions
1. How to handle the input for the decoder part. Explain the question: when we have different seq length input sentence, why we use tokenizer to padding(maybe we have two sentence, 5 words and 7 words, for each of them, would be (1,5), (1,7), but as a batch, they padding to (2,7)). For one input sentence, (1,7) for example, after embedding, it become (1,7,768), after the attention part, for one linear layer, does we input each (1,768) into the forward function?   
    1. First of all, if the we have different seq size sentence, we padding them to the longest one because we want to keep the seq size of the same batch to be the same(during one batch, one core calculate the process, in the process,  the weight and stuff keep the same, so it is one kind of parallel computation). For the layer, it do the same thing, it keep the weight of the layer, and forward the input, for (7, 768), it just like you have 7 core to handle (1, 768) with the same weight.  
2. The document search may have a potential problem, it only take the first seq for matching.

    1. I think this is because the Bert model have a CLS and eos, the first one is bos, and it takes the info. This make it a bad performance.

# Proposed work  
- [ ] take the ai vtuber project into account  
Ikaros-521/AI-Vtuber: AI Vtuber是一个由 【ChatterBot/ChatGPT/claude/langchain本地or云端/chatglm/text-generation-webui】 驱动的虚拟主播【Live2D】，可以在 【Bilibili/抖音/快手】 直播中与观众实时互动 或 直接在本地进行聊天。它使用自然语言处理和文本转语音技术【edge-tts/VITS/elevenlabs】生成对观众问题的回答并可以选择【so-vits-svc】变声；通过特定指令协同Stable Diffusion进行画图展示。并且可以自定义文案进行循环播放。 (github.com)

# After work
- [x] Linux Learning  
- [ ] Create a data scientist resume  
- [ ] apply for fall job
